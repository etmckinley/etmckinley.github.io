  description: "Building off the previous Replication Project article, we show that the predictability of a league is stongly correlated to how unequal the league is. Furthermore, if you break the top European leagues down into mini-leagues of teams of equal strengths, the predictablility plummets. This finding raises multiple questions about the utility of analytics across different leagues."

While xG was indeed the best predictor, other metrics were not as far behind in recent years than it was in the past and MLS was more unpredictable than European leagues."
